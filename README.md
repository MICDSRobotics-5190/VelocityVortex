Welcome to the Github repository for FTC team #5190, Technoramic!

All of our current code for the 2016-2017 season, Velocity vortex, is in ftc_app under TeamCode. 

The code we are using for the Turkey Train robot, which still uses Robot C with a LEGO Mindstorms NXT, is in the Turkey Train folder.

Thanks for visiting!
